# Meet the GitPitch Family

### About Me

Hi, I'm David. The solo founder and developer of GitPitch. I've been flipping bits for work and pleasure for over 30 years. These days I spend my time crafting all things GitPitch.

### GitPitch Desktop

The [Desktop app](/desktop/) is a markdown presentation tool delivered using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows 10. The desktop app lets you develop, preview, present, and publish slide decks.

### GitPitch.com

The [GitPitch Cloud](/cloud/) is an online service that works seamlessly with GitPitch Desktop. It lets you publish public, private, and password-protected slide decks on **gitpitch.com**. With nothing more than a simple *git-push* to any GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository in the cloud. 

### GitPitch Enterprise

[GitPitch Enterprise](/enterprise/) is a solution for business and education that delivers **gitpitch.com** server functionality for on-premises deployment. A solution optimized for privacy and control. Letting your business get more out of existing Git infrastructure and investment.

### GitPitch CI/CD

[GitPitch CI/CD](/cicd/) is a solution for business and education that generates GitPitch PDF, PPTX, and JPG slide screenshots directly within your existing CI/CD pipelines. Like any CI/CD pipeline job, GitPitch CI/CD can be launched in response to events such as a commit, tag, or release on target branches and repositories.

### GitPitch Open Source

I began GitPitch as an _open-source_ project in early 2016. That project was developed and maintained on GitHub. While no longer open source, the original project repo is now used to maintain a CHANGELOG alongside the source for these docs. That repo is found [here](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch).
